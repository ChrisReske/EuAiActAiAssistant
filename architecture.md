# Chatbot Architecture

## Overview

The chatbot is structured into **three main components**:

1. **Frontend Interface** – Handles user interaction.
2. **Backend Server** – Processes user input and retrieves responses.
3. **Database** – Stores structured AI Act information.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI API** – Language processing.
- **FlowiseAI** – Manages chatbot logic.
- **Render** – Original cloud deployment.
- **Pinecone** – Vector database for retrieval.
